Kunda, a highly sensitive indicator of Lagna and degree, provides a method for refining birth time. I've personally found this technique useful. Accurate birth time is essential for divisional chart analysis, and therefore, life event verification is paramount. Kunda's optimal placement within the Dharma Trines relative to Lagna and the 7th house is critical. While Saravali and Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra offer different perspectives on Kunda, my experience suggests this particular method yields more accurate results. If Kunda falls outside these placements, adjust the birth time according to the calculated adjustments. Alternatively, directly calculate the D-81 Lagna to determine the closest match for Kunda's alignment within the Dharma Trines of the D-1 chart.
