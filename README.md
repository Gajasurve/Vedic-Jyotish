# Vedic-Jyotish
My Scripts related to birth time rectification and divine Jyotish calculations.

THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR LAGNA LORD IS IN PARIVARTANA. I WILL WRITE PARVIARTANA KUNDA SPERATELY FOR THAT.

Kunda.go Takes inout with commas. If your lagna/Asendent  is Pi 19Â°37'27'' , give input as pi,19,37,27 . I found its easy to give in this way rather than breaking head over handing min and seconds with quotes.

Take your lagna degree as input. Below is sample example of birth on 29 Apirl with pisces ascendant.

Kunda, a highly sensitive indicator of Lagna and degree, provides a method for refining birth time. I've personally found this technique useful. Accurate birth time is essential for divisional chart analysis, and therefore, life event verification is paramount. Kunda's optimal placement within the Dharma Trines relative to Lagna and the 7th house is critical. While Saravali and Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra offer different perspectives on Kunda, my experience suggests this particular method yields more accurate results. If Kunda falls outside these placements, adjust the birth time according to the calculated adjustments. Alternatively, directly calculate the D-81 Lagna to determine the closest match for Kunda's alignment within the Dharma Trines of the D-1 chart.

If there is lagna lord parivartan this might fail. Still unclear on if lagna parviartan degree has to considered or planet involved. Changing signs simpley keeping the same degree will work? No idea. have to learn more.
